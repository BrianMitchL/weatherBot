# weatherBot
A Twitter bot for weather. Yahoo! Weather is used for weather information. A WOEID is used for the location. I have not added support for easy/constant changing for using Celcius or other measurements. In other words, Fahrenheit and MPH are currently hardcoded. If you would like to see this as a feature, submit a pull request, or bug me to implement it ðŸ˜œ.

_**Note: This bot uses vulgar language. Any language or wording suggestions are appreciated and should be submitted as an issue.**_

An example bot can be found at [@MorrisMNWeather](https://twitter.com/MorrisMNWeather).

## Install Dependencies
Run the following from the repository root directory to install the needed dependencies. If pip is not installed, install it via yum, apt-get, homebrew, or whatever works on your system.
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Use
There are two mode to use weatherBot. One is running from a console, and the other is by forking the process into a daemon. By default, the debug level is logged to the console and the info level is logged to the log file. The idea with this is that you run the script from the console to test and debug, and daemonize it to run it in "production." To run from as a daemon, pass in the `-d` flag:
```shell
python weatherBot.py -d
```
If you wish to run it in a console, just run normally:
```shell
python weatherBot.py
```

### Setting Variables and Customizing
There is a constants section near the top of the weatherBot.py file where you can set constants. The following are constants that can be set in the weatherBot.py file
* `WOEID` *defaults to 2454256 (Morris, MN)*
* `TWEET_LOCATION` *defaults to true*
* `LOG_PATHNAME` *defaults to '~/weatherBot.log'* **Note: The complete path name needs to be specified**

The keys.py file is where the Twitter app consumer key and secret as well as the access token key and secret are entered so tweets can be posted. See [https://apps.twitter.com] to get your keys and secrets.

The wording for tweets can be edited or added in the text list in `makeNormalTweet()` and the appropriate returns in `makeSpecialTweet()`. Additional special weather events can also be added as extra elif's in `makeSpecialTweet()`. Mind the order so more or less common ones are called when not desired.

Timing of daily scheduled tweets are done by setting the hour and minute in the else condition of the while loop in `main()`. *Note: if a tweet is set to go out when minute=59, set the .replace in the appropriate if statement below it to roll over the next minute to the hour. The minute field only accepts 0..59*
